It's like looking into a mirror that reflects another mirror, creating an infinite regression. In programming, recursion consists of two key components: the base case and the recursive case. The base case is the condition that stops the recursion, preventing infinite loops. The recursive case is where the function calls itself with modified arguments, moving closer to the base case. A classic example is calculating factorial: factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4) = 5 * 4 * factorial(3) = 5 * 4 * 3 * factorial(2) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Another famous example is computing Fibonacci numbers, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Recursion is particularly powerful for tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and backtracking problems. However, recursive solutions can lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth is too large, and they may be less efficient than iterative solutions due to function call overhead. Understanding when to use recursion versus iteration is a crucial skill for every programmer.\"\"\"\n",

    "    long_prompt = \"\"\"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves building mathematical models that can identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time. The core components of machine learning include data, features, models, and learning algorithms. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for tasks like classification and regression. Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data through techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Reinforcement learning involves agents learning to interact with environments by receiving rewards or penalties. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, are powerful machine learning models consisting of interconnected layers of nodes. Deep learning, a subset of neural networks, uses multiple hidden layers to learn complex representations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image processing, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers dominate sequential data tasks like language modeling. Popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn have democratized access to these powerful tools. Real-world applications span healthcare (diagnosis), finance (fraud detection), transportation (autonomous vehicles), and entertainment (recommendation systems). However, machine learning faces challenges including data quality, model interpretability, bias and fairness, and computational requirements. As the field continues advancing, it promises to transform industries and improve lives worldwide.\"\"\"\n",

    "    very_long_prompt = \"\"\"Software documentation is essential communication that explains how to use, maintain, and contribute to a software project. Good documentation serves multiple audiences including end users, developers, system administrators, and contributors. User documentation focuses on features, installation, configuration, and troubleshooting guides. Developer documentation covers architecture, API references, coding standards, and contribution guidelines. Key principles of effective documentation include clarity, completeness, consistency, and currency. Documentation should be written in plain language with clear examples and code snippets. Version control systems like Git help track documentation changes alongside code changes. Common documentation formats include README files, Markdown documents, API documentation generators like Swagger and Doxygen, and documentation sites built with tools like MkDocs and Sphinx. Modern documentation practices emphasize interactive examples, video tutorials, and community-driven content. Automated documentation generation reduces manual effort and ensures documentation stays synchronized with code. Poor documentation leads to user frustration, increased support costs, and project abandonment. Conversely, comprehensive documentation accelerates onboarding, reduces bugs, and fosters community contributions. Best practices include documenting design decisions, maintaining changelogs, providing code examples for all APIs, and regularly reviewing documentation for accuracy. Technical writers and developers collaborate to produce documentation that balances depth with accessibility, ensuring the software reaches its full potential.\n",

    "Additional content to reach target length: The software development lifecycle encompasses planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban have transformed how teams deliver software iteratively. Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate testing and deployment processes. Testing strategies include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality. Code review practices improve code quality and knowledge sharing among team members. Performance optimization involves profiling, benchmarking, and identifying bottlenecks in code. Security considerations must be integrated throughout the development lifecycle. Scalability and availability requirements drive architecture decisions. Cloud computing platforms provide infrastructure for deploying and scaling applications. Open source software has revolutionized how technology evolves through community collaboration and shared knowledge. Understanding these concepts provides a foundation for professional software engineering practice.\"\"\"\n",
