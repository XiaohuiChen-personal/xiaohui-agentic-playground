## Practical buying advice (based on review patterns)
If you’re considering the WH-1000XM4, reviewers’ experiences suggest these steps:
- **Buy from a retailer with an easy return/exchange policy**, just in case you get a unit with hinge/charging issues.
- **Use the Sony Headphones Connect app** early to:
  - set EQ (to reduce bass if needed)
  - configure multipoint and smart features to your liking
- If **call quality** is a top priority, consider an alternative (or plan to use an external mic for work calls).
- If you’re hard on headphones and durability matters most, some reviewers suggest looking at the **newer Sony XM5** (note: XM5 doesn’t fold, but is often considered improved in durability—worth comparing).

---

## Bottom-line recommendation
**Great choice for:** travel, commuting, focusing at work, and music listening—especially if **ANC + battery + sound customization** are your top priorities.  
**Proceed with caution if:** you need **excellent call mic quality** or you want something that feels very rugged/premium in materials—because **hinge/build complaints** are the biggest recurring downside.

### Notable Review Excerpts:

**Positive Review (5 stars):**
> *"I bought these headphones just over a month ago and I must say, I'm very pleased I did. The sound quality and noise cancellation quality is amazing – a BIG upgrade from my previous headphones... Battery life is excellent too, only charged once since I got them."* — saf22, sony.co.uk

**Critical Review (4 stars):**
> *"They are very plasticky... The headphones creak and make noise when you adjust them or move them on your head which is noticeable even with the noise cancelling... for the full asking price I would be pretty disappointed with the build quality and materials."* — Slowing down fast, sony.co.uk

**Negative Review (1 star):**
> *"Not even two months from purchasing them after using them only a handful of times, the metal frame inside the headband bent... Sony couldn't care less. I've never met a company so unwilling to help."* — Mol14, sony.co.uk

### Recommendation:

**Conditionally Recommended with Caution**

The Sony WH-1000XM4 delivers excellent noise cancellation and sound quality that rivals or exceeds competitors like Bose QuietComfort. For music listening, travel, and focus work, these headphones excel. The vast majority of 31,000+ reviewers (82%) rate them 5 stars.

**However, potential buyers should be aware:**
- Build quality concerns are legitimate—handle with care
- Not ideal for video conferencing due to microphone limitations
- Consider purchasing from a retailer with a good return policy in case of hinge or charging defects
- Stock sound benefits significantly from EQ customization via the Sony Headphones Connect app
- If durability is paramount, the newer XM5 (which doesn't fold but has reinforced hinges) may be worth considering

**Best for:** Music listeners, travelers, commuters, and those who prioritize ANC and sound quality over build ruggedness.

**Not ideal for:** Video conferencing users, those who need a quality microphone, or users who are rough with their equipment.
