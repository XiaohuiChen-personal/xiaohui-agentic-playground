# Curriculum Crew Tasks Configuration (Flow-Based)
# These tasks are used by CurriculumFlow for multi-step curriculum generation.
#
# Note: expected_output is NOT defined here because we use output_pydantic
# in the code. The Pydantic model defines the expected output structure.
#
# Flow Steps:
# 1. create_outline_task: Curriculum Architect creates course skeleton
# 2. expand_module_task: Content Researcher expands each module (parallel)
# 3. Aggregation: Pure Python, no task needed

# =============================================================================
# STEP 1: Create Curriculum Outline
# =============================================================================
# Agent: Curriculum Architect (Gemini 3 Pro)
# Purpose: Design high-level course structure with module titles and concept names
# Output: CurriculumOutline Pydantic model (defined in code)

create_outline_task:
  description: >
    Design a curriculum OUTLINE for teaching: {topic}
    
    Learner Profile:
    - Experience Level: {experience_level}
    - Learning Style: {learning_style}
    - Goals: {goals}
    
    Your Task:
    1. Analyze the topic scope and depth
    2. Define 5-6 modules in logical learning order (foundational → advanced)
    3. For each module, list 3-5 concept TITLES (just names, no content)
    4. Estimate time per module (typically 60-90 minutes each)
    
    IMPORTANT: Output only the structure, NOT detailed content. Keep it concise.

# =============================================================================
# STEP 2: Expand Single Module
# =============================================================================
# Agent: Content Researcher (Claude Opus 4.5)
# Purpose: Expand one module with full concept content
# Output: ModuleOutput Pydantic model (defined in code)
# Note: This task runs in PARALLEL for all modules

expand_module_task:
  description: >
    Expand the following module with DETAILED concept content for: {topic}
    
    Course Context:
    - Course Title: {course_title}
    - Experience Level: {experience_level}
    - Learning Style: {learning_style}
    
    Module to Expand:
    - Title: {module_title}
    - Description: {module_description}
    - Order: {module_order}
    - Estimated Minutes: {estimated_minutes}
    - Concept Titles to Cover: {concept_titles}
    
    Your Task:
    For each concept title listed above, create detailed content that includes:
    1. Clear explanation of the concept (2-3 paragraphs)
    2. Key points and takeaways
    3. Common misconceptions to avoid
    4. Practical applications or examples
    
    Adapt content to the learner's style:
    - Visual: Include ASCII diagrams and visual representations
    - Reading: Provide detailed written explanations
    - Hands-on: Focus on code examples and practical exercises
    
    IMPORTANT: Focus on QUALITY content for THIS module only.
