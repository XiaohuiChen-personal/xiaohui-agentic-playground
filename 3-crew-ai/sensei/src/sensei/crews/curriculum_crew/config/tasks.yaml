    Design a comprehensive curriculum structure for teaching: {topic}
    
    Consider the learner's profile:
    - Experience Level: {experience_level}
    - Learning Style: {learning_style}
    - Learning Goals: {goals}
    
    Your task:
    1. Analyze the full scope of the topic
    2. Break it down into 5-10 logical learning modules
    3. Order modules by prerequisite relationships (foundational → advanced)
    4. Define clear learning objectives for each module
    5. Estimate realistic time per module (in minutes, typically 60-240 minutes each)
    
    Adapt the curriculum depth and pace based on the learner's experience level:
    - Beginner: More foundational modules, slower pace, extra context
    - Intermediate: Balanced approach, assume basic knowledge
    - Advanced: Focus on advanced topics, faster pace, deeper content
  expected_output: >
    A structured JSON course outline with the following format:
    {
      "title": "Course title based on the topic",
      "description": "Brief course description (2-3 sentences)",
      "modules": [
        {
          "title": "Module title",
          "description": "What this module covers and key learning objectives",
          "order": 0,
          "estimated_minutes": <number between 60-240>
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    
    Important:
    - Modules must be ordered from foundational to advanced (order starts at 0)
    - Include 5-10 modules total
    - estimated_minutes should be realistic (60-240 minutes per module)
    - Include learning objectives in each module's description

research_content_task:
  description: >
    Using the curriculum structure provided, research and define the key concepts
    for each module in the course about: {topic}
    
    Curriculum structure to expand:
    {curriculum_structure}
    
    For each module, you must:
    1. Identify 3-7 key concepts that cover the module's learning objectives
    2. Define clear learning points for each concept
    3. Note common misconceptions learners face
    4. Include practical applications and real-world examples
    5. Order concepts from foundational to advanced within each module
    
    Each concept should be learnable in approximately 10-20 minutes.
    Ensure concepts build upon each other logically within the module.
  expected_output: >
    A complete JSON course structure with detailed concepts:
    {
      "title": "Course title",
      "description": "Course description",
      "modules": [
        {
          "title": "Module title",
          "description": "Module description with learning objectives",
          "order": 0,
          "estimated_minutes": <number>,
          "concepts": [
            {
              "title": "Concept title",
              "content": "A comprehensive description that includes:\n\n**Overview:**\nBrief description of what will be learned.\n\n**Key Learning Points:**\n- Point 1\n- Point 2\n- Point 3\n\n**Common Misconceptions:**\n- Misconception 1 and why it's wrong\n\n**Practical Applications:**\n- Real-world application example",
              "order": 0
            },
            ...
          ]
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    
    Important:
    - Each module should have 3-7 concepts
    - Concepts must be ordered within each module (order starts at 0)
    - The "content" field must be a markdown-formatted string containing:
      * Overview of the concept
      * Key learning points as a bulleted list
      * Common misconceptions learners face
      * Practical applications and examples
    - Concepts should be specific and well-defined
    - Do NOT include "id" fields - they will be auto-generated
